**More detailed migration notes:**

* This new version upgrades the internal nova media database to a new scheme and any downgrade to v4/v5 versions of nova will wipe out your entire video collection to prevent any incompatibility.
* This version switches to theMovieDb for retrieving TV shows information instead of theTvDb. It is strongly recommended to rescrape all your TV shows or start from a fresh install.
* Proper support for movie collections and animation movies/series on AndroidTV requires some manual steps. Acquisition of the additional movie collection informations and movies/TV series genres realignment requires a full rescrape of your video without interference of existing .nfo files (that do not yet contain the required information). For that purpose the following steps should do the trick:
    * backup all your customized handcrafted .nfo file (if you have any)
    * install nova version 6.xx
    * in nova settings unselect "process '.nfo' files"
    * in nova settings launch a "rescrape all" and wait for completion
    * in nova settings launch an "export already scraped videos" and wait for completion (**this step will override any existing .nfo file**)
* versions later than v6.0.30 targets API31 and due to Android storage restrictions for API30, local NFO/JPG media information files for videos stored on local storage have been moved to nova public application folder located /sdcard/Android/data/org.courville.nova/files/nfoPoster 
 * If you ever want to get back to nova v5.xx, you will need to clean application data *and cache*

## [v6.0.1 experimental release: support for movie collection](https://github.com/nova-video-player/aos-AVP/releases/tag/v6.0.1) - 2020-11-29

- Add support for movie collections/sagas for AndroidTV leanback interface

**Important note for migrating:** all already scraped movies do not contain any information about collections.
In order to add this missing information you need to rescrape the full movie collection.
A setting has been added to perform this task.
However, by default nova does process .nfo files which are exported part of the scraping which also does not contain movie collection information in order to speed up the scraping process.
These .nfo files when triggering a rescrape would be processed and would result into again no information found on collections.
Thus in order to get the movie collection data you need either to: deinstall/reinstall nova and delete all .nfo files on your internal storage or network shares or to follow these steps:
- install nova version 6.x
- in settings unselect "process '.nfo' files"
- in settings launch a "rescrape all movies" and wait for completion
- in settings launch an "export already scraped videos" and wait for completion

Current limitations:
- sometimes there is no poster/backdrop found for a collection: this is simply because TheMovieDb does not reference one
